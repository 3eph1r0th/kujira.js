     * A URL/resource name that uniquely identifies the type of the serialized
     * protocol buffer message. This string must contain at least
     * one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path must represent
     * the fully qualified name of the type (as in
     * `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in a canonical form
     * (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).
     *
     * In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary all types that they
     * expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for URLs which use the
     * scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally set up a type
     * server that maps type URLs to message definitions as follows:
     *
     * * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.
     * * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a [google.protobuf.Type][]
     *   value in binary format, or produce an error.
     * * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based on the
     *   URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
     *   lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
     *   on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
     *   breaking changes.)
     *
     * Note: this functionality is not currently available in the official
     * protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs beginning with
     * type.googleapis.com.
     *
     * Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme) might be
     * used with implementation specific semantics.
